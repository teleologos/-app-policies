    <h1>Privacy Policy for Tongue Analysis TCM</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: February 13, 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection & Usage</h2>
    <p>Tongue Analysis TCM does not collect, store, or share any personal information. The app functions without requiring users to create an account or provide any personally identifiable details.</p>
    <p>The only data used within the app includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tongue images uploaded by users for analysis.</li>
        <li>The corresponding AI-generated analysis results.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These images and results are used only to improve the accuracy of our AI-driven tongue analysis. The data is processed in a non-identifiable manner and is not linked to any individual user.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Handle Images & Analysis Results</h2>
    <p>Images uploaded for analysis are processed temporarily and are not permanently stored on our servers. After processing, the images are discarded, and no user-specific data is retained. Analysis results are generated locally on your device whenever possible, or processed securely on our servers without user tracking. The data is only used for AI model improvement in an anonymized and aggregated manner, ensuring no individual user can be identified.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services & Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share, sell, or distribute user data to any third parties. However, we may use third-party AI services to enhance our analysis capabilities. These services are selected based on strict data privacy standards. If any third-party services are involved, they are required to comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other global data protection laws.</p>
    <p>We do not:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Share data with advertisers or marketing agencies.</li>
        <li>Sell user data to any third parties.</li>
        <li>Use data for purposes beyond improving the appâ€™s functionality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Your Rights & Choices</h2>
    <p>As a user, you have full control over your data. Since we do not collect personal data, there is no need for account deletion requests. However, we respect your rights under global data protection laws, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Right to Access:</strong> You can review the data processed by the app (your uploaded images and results).</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Deletion:</strong> If you wish to remove any data associated with your usage, simply stop using the app, as no data is permanently stored.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Opt-Out:</strong> If you do not wish for your images to contribute to AI improvements, do not upload them for analysis.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have any concerns about privacy, you may contact us directly at [Your Support Email].</p>

    <h2>5. Data Security Measures</h2>
    <p>We implement strong security practices to protect all processed data, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>End-to-end encryption for data transmission.</li>
        <li>Secure processing protocols for AI image analysis.</li>
        <li>No long-term data storage, reducing risks of data breaches.</li>
        <li>Compliance with global data protection laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We continuously update our security measures to protect against unauthorized access, misuse, or data leaks.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Updates will be posted within the app or on our official website. Continued use of the app after changes implies acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
